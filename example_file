Hello, this is my example file
Hopefully I understand github by the end of the day
Then I will move on to understanding UNIX
I guess I should have been a computer science major
Now I am making a new revision, we'll call this revision 1
Now I am making a second revision, hopefully this works
How about a third revision?
Let's see how branching works, I should have this line in the test branch, but not in the master

Now I'll try combining branches, I'll add this line to the combo_branch and then make a change in the master to see if they will merge


What if I add a new line here? Will this merge with the combo_branch?

I'm interested to see what happens when I merge this with the master that had previous lines deleted...?

JK I guess I can't merge them...?

Completely restarting this example repo so I can relearn github
Adding a new line just bc I can
